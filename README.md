### **Flight Prediction Philippines**  

A machine learning project designed to predict flight outcomes in the Philippines, including delays and other factors. This repository includes tools and resources for training your own model, exploring the data, and making predictions using a pre-trained model.  

---

### **Features:**  
- Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluating your own custom flight prediction model  
- Pre-processing scripts for data cleaning and preparation  
- Pre-trained model saved in `.pkl` format for immediate use

### **Getting Started**  

#### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-prediction-philippines.git
cd flight-prediction-philippines  
```  

#### **Step 2: Install Requirements**  
Make sure you have Python installed. Install the required libraries by running:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

#### **Step 3: Train Your Own Model (Optional)**  
Open the Jupyter Notebook provided to train your own flight prediction model:  
```bash  
jupyter notebook flight_prediction_training.ipynb  
```  

#### **Step 4: Use Pre-Trained Model**  
The pre-trained model is saved as `c1_flight_rf.pkl`. You can load and use it directly for predictions using pickle:  

```python  
import pickle  

with open('flight_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:  
    model = pickle.load(file)  

# Example usage  
sample_input = [/* your input features */]  
prediction = model.predict([sample_input])  
print("Prediction:", prediction)  
```
